    "## Know Your LP \n",
    "\n",
    "[Plexo Capital](https://plexocap.com/) is an institutional investor allocating capital globally to the startup ecosystem. On the LP side, we targeted sub USD 100M funds in fund I where their primary entry point for investment is pre seed or seed and they are leading the majority of their deals. We are still planning the strategy for fund II, and fund II will continue the focus on sub USD 100M funds and likely include some funds over USD 100M with an entry point of seed and small Series A rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being data driven, we are disciples of the [power law distribution of returns](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/06/power-laws-in-venture.html) in early stage venture capital. As a result, we focus on GPs that can lead the majority of their deals which helps with both ownership levels and has the byproduct of minimizing the overlap in the underlying portfolios of our GPs. That allows us to cast as wide a net as possible to capture outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We source our direct investments from the portfolios of our GPs. Since an important component of our strategy is to provide downstream deal flow to our LPs, which include [Alphabet/GV](https://www.gv.com/), [Intel Capital](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intel-capital/overview.html), [Cisco Investments](https://www.ciscoinvestments.com/) and [RBC](https://www.rbccm.com/en/about-us.page), we try to align our selection with those GPs we feel will construct a portfolio of companies that will be of interest to those LPs that also invest directly.  As far as sector focus, we prefer generalist funds that invest mainly in enterprise, marketplaces + technology enabled consumer. If we lean in any direction, it would be towards enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our data and research, fund I targeted ~21 LP commitments. At this stage, we have committed to 20 funds (including the original five LP commitments that we made at GV which came over to the Plexo Capital portfolio) in Plexo Capital I. If we make another LP commitment in fund I (highly unlikely), we are looking at generalist funds in geographies outside of the United States and funds in the US with a thesis that might benefit in a post COVID-19 environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of our commitments were made to funds where we built relationships over the first two years while we incubated inside GV.  We also like to spend about 10 hours getting to know a manager in a combination of 1:1 meetings, phone calls and catch ups at conferences. Therefore, if we are off from a timing perspective, we want to be prepared in the future for our subsequent funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would be great to schedule a meeting to learn more about your fund. To maintain a level playing field for access, we take a page our of the playbook of our LP [Kapor Capital](https://www.kaporcapital.com/) and ask all GPs + entrepreneurs to fill out the [form below](https://airtable.com/shru2gLH98tLjxIp8) so that we can gather more information about your fund and prepare for a productive meeting.  After the form submission, it will redirect to a page to schedule a meeting with [Vishal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vtripathi30/) + [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-toney/).\n",

    "The aim would be to maximize the returns coming from each bucket and at the same time minimizing the downside risk. Given the analysis is being done for private markets and the returns are not normally distributed, the use of downside risk is the perfect factor to not penalise the underliers for high return. The measurement we use for this is the semi-variance (described [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/semivariance.asp)). This idea is inspired by the use of [Sortino Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortino_ratio) and discussions by [Fama-French](https://famafrench.dimensional.com/questions-answers/qa-semi-variance-a-better-risk-measure.aspx).\n",

For our Core GPs and for Direct Investments, the risk is considered only below a 1x return, while for the Beta GPs and Senior GPs, risk is considered below the mean returns as suggested by the papers. This is because of our fund structure preference with the GPs in the 15MM - 100MM range and a better deal flow compensating for the risk.\n",
